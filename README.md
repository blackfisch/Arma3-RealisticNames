# Arma3 Realistic Names

This project aims to provide a small mod that changes the names of Weapons, Vehicles and Gear in Arma 3 to their real life names. Since this is a feature of [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) already, this mod makes use of it by simply stripping it out and distributing it standalone. 

# Getting started

This mod requires Arma 3 and the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/releases">CBA A3</a>.

# Disclaimer

This project basically is a Standalone of the [realisticnames module](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/tree/master/addons/realisticnames) from [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3).

Special Thanks to all [ACE3 Contributors](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt) who made this project possible in the first place.
